    <h1 class="blog">Peer review Natasja Schaafsma</h1>
    <h1 class ="blog" style="float:right">17 October 2018</h1>
     <p>I reviewed the website of Natasja Schaafsma. You can check out her website <a href="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/nschaafsma/">here</a>.<br><p class="thick">General information:</p>The website looks really clean and styled. Everything seems to fit together. It has one uniform style. It has a lot of detailed information about the creator. It has seperate icons for stuff like social media and how to contact her. All information seems to be in place.<br><p class="thick">Design:</p>The website has a consistent layout and design througout the whole website. Eventhough it is clear a template was used, it seems to be altered to the likings of the creator.  All present images are very personal which give it a ''personal touch''.<br><p class="thick">Content:</p>There are 5 portfolio  pieces on the website with clear navigation. The preview you get on the website frontpage is very nice. I think some portfolio pieces like Flictie and the two video's are missing some information. I would like to know why the documentary was made and what kind of pictures you made for Flictie.<br><p class="thick">Function:</p>The website has a design in which you can scroll down to see (almost) everything that is on it. You do have articles and dropdowns on which you click for more information. Navigation is nice and straightforward. <br><p class="thick">Connections:</p>All information like emailadres and social media is available. It even has a seperate section in which you can leave a message.<br><p class="thick">Overall score: 4.6/5 stars!</p><br><p class="thick">How was the website made?</p><p>The website is a template from Adventure Studio. The template had all kinds of stylesheets for different sections of the website. The animations, lightboxes and sliders all have their own stylesheet. The template is build so that the homepage is very long with al the seperate sections of the site on it, like the portfolio and blog. The code has a lot of classes for every part of the website. Every section (About, Portfolio,  Gallery, Blog and Contact) Has their own ID listed in the code. This way the navigation bar can jump you to the part of the page you want to go to.</p><p class="thick"> What did I learn from reviewing?</p><p>I learned that you can make a really nice website using a template. Only thing you still have left to do is fill it with youre own text and pictures. I also learned that my own website can still be improved a lot. I still need to fix little things (like the hyperlink to my email) and the map on my contact page. I still have plans for my website a lot. For example the portfolio part, this still needs its own navigation.</p>

    <h1 class="blog">My style</h1>
    <h1 class ="blog" style="float:right">3 October 2018</h1>
     <p>In a previous blog post I described how I wanted my website to look like. At first my site looked really boring with a grey color scheme. Now I have added some fresh colors like blue and orange. My website looking fresh was also a must. I added a light font for the pieces of text and changed the header of my name to a bold large font. From the beginning I wanted to use the color blue in my website, because it is my favourite color. A color scheme I found online (dont know which site anymore) inspired me to use the bright blue with orange tones. I think my website still needs less empty space and more images or interactivity. In the near future I want to change the portfolio part of my website to have diffrent pages for the different programs I made creations in.</p>

    <h1 class="blog">Update: Film project</h1>
    <h1 class="blog" style="float:right">24 September 2018</h1>
     <p>This is the first blog post about our project for We Create Identity. We have to make an interactive movie with at least 8 different storylines. We have had two planned meetings already in which we discussed how we are going to tackle this. We agreed on the subject of our movie. Which is going to be "Dating nowadays". With this subject we want to emphasize the fact that poeple and dating in this modern time is different and that we lose social interaction between people. Dating has now become a game in which the choice you make have direct influence. The person on the other side of the internet has the choice to like you or not. If not, you will get disconnected. Thus far the idea for our movie. We have planned test shootings and fixed deadlines.</p>

       <p>In the near future I want my website to look quite different. First I want to introduce a nice colour scheme. This has to make the website look nice and fresh. I want my site to look clean and not very much clutered. With the navigation I am fairly happy as if now, but I do need to change the names of the different tabs. I also want to make a portfolio page which has navigation to all of my different projects. I think photographs and videos are very important. I still need to think of a way how I am going to display those nicely.I still need to change a lot to my website. The content of my website still isn't complete and text still needs to be added.</p>

      </a>
      <p>Installation I liked most:<br>I really liked this installation because it was very interactive. With the cameras placed on the globe of monitors you could see it detected you and made a short clip of your movement. This short clip was send around the globe by all the monitors. I really liked that you could see all of the hardware what made up the installation. When looking in the center of the globe you could see a mainframe and the power supplies.</p>

     <p>Installation which irritated me the most:<br>I didnt really like this installation. The installation had no such backstory. What was its use?. The visuals, also shown on the included image, were very flashy and not particularly nice to look at. The installation also had loud, almost static, noise.</p>
